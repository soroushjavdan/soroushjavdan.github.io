# Summary

* What

	* They investigated how developers perform refactoring during code review. In other words, They investigated the relationship between software refactoring and code review, specially the developers’ intents and their influence on refactoring and reviewing practices.
    
    * They studied refactoring in three different aspects:
    	1. Intents: the developers' intention behide refactorings, their goals, and reasons.
        2. Compositions: 
        3. Evalution of refactoring during code review.
        
	* In their previous study they observed that developers often apply the same refactoring type during a single commit(not related to this paper but worth mentioning).
