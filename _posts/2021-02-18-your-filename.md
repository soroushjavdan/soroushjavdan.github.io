# What

* They explored the existing research and current challenges in the On-Demand Developer Documentation (OD3) field.
*  an OD3 system would automati- cally generate high-quality documentation in response to a user query
* he OD3 system would use a combination of knowledge extraction techniques on different software artifacts in order to generate proper documentation.

# Motos

* In this research _developer documentations_ are refered to artifacts like, source code comments, tutorials and ref- erence documentation for application programming interfaces (APIs), and design documentation. 
* Eventhough, the documentation is an essential resource for creating and maintaining software systems, but it suffers from two fundamental limitations.
	1. They are costly to create and maintaine.
    2. non-executable artifact whose presence and correctness are not technically critical.
       
* So, it seems reasonable to have a OD3 system to assist developer. Since, most of community and company treat documentation as a low priority task.

# Challenges

The existing challenges could divided in three main part. This is mainly because OD3 system requires advances in three areas. 
	
1. advances in **information inference** are needed to derive, find, or link information useful to developers from different types of information elements.

2. developers must be able to form a **document request** based on an incomplete or even incorrect understanding of these needs.

3. an OD3 system must be able to perform**document generation**to produce high-quality documents that address the information needs of developers.
