I remember the day as if it were yesterday, I was six years old, and my dad took me to his office. That was the first time I saw a computer. He showed me how they could help us to ease our tasks. As a child, I was amazed by their applications, and I became curious to learn how they work. Gradually, during high school, my interest got increased by reading more about technology and seeing the fast development of the computer science field. This long-standing interest persuaded me to follow Computer Science as my major at university.
