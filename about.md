I am in the last year of my masterâ€™s degree at the Iran Science and Technology University and a member of Future Networks Lab under the supervision of Dr. Morteza Analoui. Currently, I am using the Transformers model and meta-learning to improve personalized dialogue generation. Additionally, I have participated as a team member on research like Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis, Offensive Language Detection and Code-Mixed Sentiment Analysis.

Taking about professional life, I started my serious programming career in 2013, which gave me a remarkable opportunity to understand programming challenges and development procedures. In 2018, I was a member of a team that develops "Jaundice detection in newborns." It was a worthy experience for me since it was always my dream to use my knowledge to improve people's health.
