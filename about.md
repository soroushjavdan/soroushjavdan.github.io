I remember the day as if it were yesterday, I was 6 years old, and my dad took me to his office. That was the first time I saw a computer. He showed me how computers are used, and how it could help them to ease their tasks. As a child, I was amazed by their applications, and I became curious to know how they work. Additionally, during high school, my interest got increased by reading more about technology and I saw the fast development of the computer science field; therefore I studied hard in high school; eventually I got a good result in entrance exam and accepted in a well-known state university. generally, I consider my self as a fighter since I faced a lot of difficulty in my life but in the end, I did my best to come up with viable solutions.  Moreover, I keen on doing sport and no matter how much busy I am I do my regular work out and find a balance between my life and study. Also, I am great in team working and an extremely inventive person.
