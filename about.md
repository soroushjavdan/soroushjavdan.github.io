I have been always a scholarly person since I was a little kid and I wanted to become a Computer Scientist in future. No sooner had I entered high school, then this desire become stronger and having started my major; I come to the realization that how much obsess I am with Computer Science and more importantly developing and creating new concepts; therefore I studied hard in high school; eventually I got a good result in entrance exam and accepted in a well-known state university. generally, I consider my self as a fighter since I faced a lot of difficulty in my life but in the end, I did my best to come up with viable solutions.  Moreover, I keen on doing sport and no matter how much busy I am I do my regular work out and find a balance between my life and study. Also, I am great in team working and an extremely inventive person.
